# Intro
The Wayside Installation Tracker is a program used to track the installation of various pieces of wayside equipment for Crosstown Partners under contract S-48012. It analyzes a spreadsheet tabulating the installation of each piece of equipment and provides a high level overview of project progress per installation type. It also organizes said data over different categories (i.e. overall progress can be displayed by station & tunnel, interlocking, or track number).

# Install

# Usage
This program currently supports seven different types of equipment:
- CMRS & Cables
- Axle Counters
- Signals
- Switches
- WRUs
- Z-Cases
- TOPBs

Each piece of equipment is represented within the code as its own class. Class definitions and attrivutes are listed below.

## CMRS & Cables
### General Definitions
The `CableSpan()` class represents the installation of cable/CMRS along portions of track. It's attributes are as follows.

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|`start`| `(int)` The stationing for the start of the cable/CMRS installation. NOTE: Do NOT use a "+" as a delimiter when writing stationings. Only use integer values (i.e. `"588+88"` --> `58888`)|
|`end`| `(int)` The stationing for the end of the cable/CMRS installation. NOTE: Do NOT use a "+" as a delimiter when writing stationings. Only use integer values (i.e. `"588+88"` --> `58888`)|
|`track`| `(string)` The track the cable/CMRS is being installed on |
|`location`| `(string)` The station/tunnel name that the cable is being installed upon |
|`type`| `(string)` The type of CMRS being installed |
|`activities`| `**VARIES**` Represented by its own class depending on `type` (see MessActivities, CMRS15Activities, CMRS24Activities, TrayActivities) |
|`notes`| `(string)` Any notes taken about specific installation |

### Messenger Activities (Definitios ctd.)
The `MessActivities()` class represents the installation of cable/CMRS along portions of track. It's attributes are as follows. Each entry is in turn represented by the `progress()` class

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|`messSupports`| `(progress)` stores total & installed messenger supports |
|`messClamps`|`(progress)` stores the total & installed messenger clamps |
|`messWirePull`|`(progress)` stores progress of messenger wire pull (refers to the main wire that cables are hung from, wire that will be tensioned) |
|`messCablesPulled`|`(progress)`
